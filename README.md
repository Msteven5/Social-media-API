## Description

This API example application was created to give an example of the way a social media application would interact with the user input through endpoints and Express.

## Installation

For this application to work as intended, you will need to clone the repository from GitHub, as well as run ```npm i``` to get all dev dependencies such as express and mongoose.

## Usage

This application can be used as a simple example of a social media backend API.

## Contributing

I, Michael Davidson am the only one that contributed to this code using MongoDB, JavaScript, Node, and the Node packages listed in the package.json.

## Test

Checkout the walkthrough video [here](https://app.screencastify.com/v3/watch/sXHKbQFqT2wKdjF0WcEG)!

Run the application in the Terminal/CLI after having NODE and the dependencies installed, to run the application and have access to an example social media API.
